### What is a work breakdown structure? How do you create one?

Work breakdown structure is a process of breaking down a complex or large project into a number of small tasks. Each smaller task is assigned to a group of people in the company. Project Managers uses this work breakdown structure for simplifying the project and completing it in the less time frame. Work breakdown structure can be created by methods using Gantt chart or the PERT/CPM.

In these charts, you must record the objective you are trying to accomplish. This objective could be anything from developing a new software feature to constructing a new building. Divide the project tasks into smaller and smaller pieces, but stop before you get to the point of listing out every action that must be taken. You must include a duration for each task. Focus on concrete deliverables rather than actions.

### What are task patterns, and how can you recognize them?

Task patterns is the sequence of work in a project. Task patterns can involve dependent tasks, multiple successor tasks, and multiple predecessor tasks.

When casks must be completed one after another, they are called dependent tasks because one depends on the other.

When several tasks can start at the same time, each is called a concurrent task. Often, two or more concurrent tasks depend on a single prior task, which is called a predecessor task. In this situation, each concurrent task is called a successor task and you have multiple of them.

You can recognize task patterns by looking carefully at the wording of the task statement. Words like then, when, or and are action words that signal a sequence of events. In a large project, the overall pattern would be quite complex.

### Compare the advantages and disadvantages of Gantt and PERT/CPM charts.

PERT and Gantt chart plays an important Role in project management. It helps the Project manager to plan a schedule for the project and shows the place in which improvement is required. The charts show the complete status of the project from start to complete.

Gantt chart represents each stage of your project. In this chart, time or duration of each task is represented in X-axis and tasks or activities are represented in Y-axis from start point of the project till completion.

### Advantages of Gantt Charts

-   Important for smaller projects. Compares and shows what the assumed progress was and what the actual progress is.
    
-   Shows the tasks completed and not yet finished. Uses different colors.
    
-   Shows total status and progress of project
    

### Disadvantages of Gantt Charts

-   Before creating a Gantt chart, users have to prepare the project plan
    
-   Does not show which task depends on other tasks.
    
-   Not made for projects which require changes. If you want to change the schedule, you must recreate the chart.
    

PERT stands for Project Evaluation Review Technique.

### Advantages of PERT Charts

-   Enables you to create milestones for your project. During the time between each milestone, you can use the chart to identify any possible outcomes or obstacles that your project may face. This means you can quickly address them, or prepare for them, to help your project stay on track.
    
-   Anyone who needs to know can quickly refer to the chart to see where a project is, how itâ€™s coming along and what stage the project is currently at. This means managing the project is so much easier.
    

### Disadvantages of PERT Charts

-   To create a proper PERT chart, a lot of time and effort needs to be invested in creating, developing and maintaining it. It can be considered very time-consuming.
